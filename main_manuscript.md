# Abstract

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI) is a powerful quantitative imaging modality used across chemistry, biophysics, biomedical optics, and microscopy. It measures the nanosecond-scale decay of fluorescence emission and provides a quantitative, intensity-independent contrast for biological imaging useful from intracellular metabolic state to *in vivo* tumor characterisation. Despites its widespread use, the data acquisition and the analysis ecosystem remains fragmented: each detector family, Intensified Charge-Coupled Devices (ICCD), Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays, and Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) microscopes, typically ships with its own proprietary file formats, vendor-specific software, and incompatible analytical conventions. This forces practitioners to maintain bespoke pipelines and limits reproducibility across hardware. I present **pyfli**, an open-source Python library that unifies FLI data ingestion, simulation, and lifetime estimation across detectors. The package implements five established analytical estimators, Non-linear Least Squares Fitting (NLSF), phasor analysis, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Rapid Lifetime Determination (RLD), and Laguerre Expansion Technique (LET) for model-free Instrument Response Function (IRF) deconvolution, alongside CPU and GPU solvers, a configurable hardware-aware noise simulator. On top of that, this package extends to a single-pixel compressed-sensing reconstruction module for hyperspectral FLI as well. The library is distributed on PyPI as `pyfli-lib`, follows a modular registry-based architecture, and is intended to lower the activation energy for both routine FLI analysis and the development of new estimators.


# Statement of need

FLI is a mature quantitative imaging modality used widely in biophysics,
microscopy, and preclinical biomedical optics [@Becker2012; @Berezin2010].
Its hardware ecosystem, however, is heterogeneous. Intensified charge-coupled
device (ICCD) cameras dominate gated wide-field and macroscopic FLI;
SPAD arrays such as SwissSPAD2/3 provide megapixel-scale photon counting
[@Bruschini2019]; TCSPC microscopes record per-pixel arrival histograms in
scanning configurations. Each platform produces data with different geometry,
noise statistics, and file conventions.

The analytical landscape is equally fragmented. Non-linear least-squares
fitting dominates classical FLIM; phasor analysis [@Digman2008] is preferred
in lipid microscopy; maximum-likelihood estimation is used in the
photon-starved regime typical of *in vivo* imaging [@Kollner1992];
Laguerre-expansion techniques [@Jo2005] address model-free deconvolution; and
deep-learning approaches [@Smith2019] now offer real-time inference when
paired with calibrated simulators. These methods are typically scattered
across vendor software, academic prototypes, and disconnected community
packages, with inconsistent APIs and few common benchmarks.

`pyfli` was developed to (i) provide a uniform Python interface across ICCD,
SPAD, and TCSPC data; (ii) expose the major analytical estimators behind
consistent class APIs so that they can be compared on the same data;
(iii) provide matched CPU and GPU backends that allow the same estimator to
scale from a single decay to multi-megapixel cubes; and (iv) include a
hardware-aware simulator producing labelled synthetic data suitable for
training and validating deep-learning models. The library targets two
audiences: experimentalists who need a reliable, format-agnostic pipeline,
and method developers who need a common substrate for prototyping and
benchmarking new lifetime estimators.

# State of the field

Several open packages address parts of the FLI workflow. `FLUTE`
[@Gottlieb2023] and `PhasorPy` [@PhasorPy2024] provide phasor-based analysis
with strong visualisation; `FLIMfit` [@Warren2013] delivers a mature graphical
environment for least-squares FLIM fitting; `napari-flim-phasor-plotter`
integrates phasor analysis into the napari ecosystem. On the simulation side,
`flimlib` provides fast curve-fitting primitives but no end-to-end pipeline.
None of these packages simultaneously target (a) data ingestion across all
three major detector families, (b) multiple estimator families behind a
common API, (c) GPU-accelerated per-pixel fitting, and (d) a calibrated noise
simulator designed for generating deep-learning training data.

`pyfli` occupies this combined niche. To our knowledge it is the first
package that bundles least-squares, phasor, maximum-likelihood, rapid
lifetime determination, and Laguerre deconvolution behind a unified Python
interface with GPU support and an integrated simulator.

# Software design

`pyfli` is implemented in pure Python (≥3.11), comprises approximately 70
modules and 12,000 lines of code, and is organised into seven thematic
sub-packages exposed through a single top-level namespace:

- **`dataIO`** — universal data and IRF loaders for `.sdt`, `.mat`, `.tif`,
  `.npy`, `.txt`, and `.asc` files, with a detector-abstracted import path
  for ICCD, SwissSPAD2/3, and TCSPC outputs.
- **`dataCC`** — IRF alignment, normalisation, region-of-interest operations,
  background subtraction, hot-pixel rejection, and pile-up correction.
- **`analytical_methods`** — phasor analysis, non-linear least-squares
  fitting, Poisson maximum-likelihood estimation, and a Laguerre Expansion
  Technique (LET) fitter for model-free IRF deconvolution.
- **`solver`** — CPU and GPU lifetime processors built on NumPy/SciPy and
  PyTorch respectively, plus binned, global, and MLE variants and a fitting
  comparator.
- **`simulator`** — a forward-model engine, parameter distribution samplers,
  modular noise models (Poisson shot noise, dark count rate, Gaussian read
  noise, gain, quantisation), batch simulators, and a calibration/validation
  engine.
- **`spAnalysis`** — single-pixel compressed-sensing reconstruction for
  hyperspectral time-resolved imaging, with Hadamard and Fourier-DCT bases
  and linear, total-variation, and Poisson-likelihood reconstructors
  [@Pian2017].
- **`dataVnP`, `roiMaker`, `utils_common`** — visualisation, ROI editing,
  and shared utilities.

Three design decisions shape the package. First, **registry-based dispatch**
(loaders, noise models, reconstructors) is preferred over deep class
hierarchies, keeping each subsystem extensible without subclassing pressure.
Second, **CPU/GPU symmetry**: the `Fli_CPUProcessor` and `Fli_GPUProcessor`
classes accept the same fitter object and dataset and produce comparable
outputs, with the GPU path using differentiable reparameterisations
(`exp` for positive scalars, `sigmoid` for amplitude fractions, offset
parameterisation for ordered lifetimes) to enforce physical bounds without
boundary-handling pathologies common in box-constrained gradient methods.
Third, the **simulator closes the loop with experiment**: `FLICalibrator`
fits simulator hyperparameters against an experimentally acquired calibration
sample, so the synthetic data used to train downstream deep-learning models
matches the noise statistics of the target instrument.

Quality control is provided by a `pytest` suite covering parameter
validation, distribution sampling, noise model statistics, phasor coordinate
computation, and the Laguerre fitter. Tests use only synthetic NumPy arrays
and require no external data.

# Research impact statement

`pyfli` consolidates analytical methods and hardware support that previously
required several disconnected codebases, lowering the activation energy for
laboratories adopting FLI as a quantitative readout. By exposing
least-squares, phasor, MLE, RLD, and Laguerre estimators behind a common API
on identical data, it enables direct method comparison — a step that is
needed for principled estimator selection but has historically been
discouraged by interface friction. The matched CPU/GPU backends additionally
allow the same pipeline to scale from a single calibration decay to
multi-megapixel preclinical FLI cubes, supporting both bench-scale
methodological work and high-throughput biomedical studies.

The integrated simulator and calibration engine are intended to support the
growing body of work on deep-learning FLI inference, where realistic, labelled
training data calibrated to specific detectors is a recurrent bottleneck
[@Smith2019]. By generating training corpora that match the noise statistics
of a target instrument, `pyfli` aims to make these methods more reproducible
across laboratories and detector platforms.
